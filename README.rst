metaextract is a tool to collect metadata about a python module. For example
you may have a sdist tarball from the `Python Package Index`_ and you want to
know it's dependencies. metaextract can collect theses dependencies.
The tool was first developed in `py2pack`_ but is now it's own module to be
useful for others, too.
